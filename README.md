A simple Java program that displays information about the local machine,  
checks the reachability of a remote IP address, and scans the local network  
to detect active hosts within the same subnet.

2. **Remote host check (by IP only)**
    - Connects directly using `InetAddress.getByAddress()`
    - Displays remote IP information
    - Checks if the host is reachable (`isReachable()`)
    - Detects if the address is multicast
